        "- The goal of the project is to develop a time series model that accurately predicts unit sales at different locations for Favorita stores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Questions to be Asked:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?\n",
        "2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?\n",
        "3. Did the earthquake impact sales?\n",
        "4. Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)\n",
        "5. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?\n",
        "6. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?\n",
        "7. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, and MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)\n",
